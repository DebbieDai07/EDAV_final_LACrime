# Introduction

Crime rate is one of the most critical problems that draws attention from residents and society, as it is closely related to the well-being and safety of our daily lives. Los Angeles (LA), as a populous, major city in the United States with a prosperous economy and developed tourism, is also known for its high crime rate. The diversity of LA has resulted in a variety of crime types, with significant differences due to factors such as race, gender, and community.

In our project, we intend to use the dataset provided by the Los Angeles Police Department to analyze crime data in Los Angeles. We plan to explore various trends, such as the prevalence of specific crimes in different communities and time patterns of crime peaks during certain periods of the year or day. We also aim to understand the factors that contribute to variations in crime rates. By finding answers through our analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights for community members, police officers, and policymakers to work more effectively. Ultimately, we hope our analysis will guide important decision-making to enhance public safety and deepen understanding of how crime affects the diverse population of Los Angeles.
