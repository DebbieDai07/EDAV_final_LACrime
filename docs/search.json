    "text": "1 Introduction\nCrime rate is one of the most critical problems that draws attention from residents and society, as it is closely related to the well-being and safety of our daily lives. Los Angeles (LA), as a populous in the United States with a prosperous economy and developed tourism, is also known for its high crime rate. The diversity of LA has resulted in a variety of crime types, with significant differences due to factors such as race, gender, and community.\nIn our project, we intend to use the dataset provided by the Los Angeles Police Department to analyze crime data in Los Angeles. We plan to explore various trends, such as the prevalence of specific crimes in different communities and time patterns of crime peaks during certain periods of the year or day. We also aim to understand the factors that contribute to variations in crime rates. By finding answers through our analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights for community members, police officers, and policymakers to work more effectively. Ultimately, we hope our analysis will guide important decision making to enhance public safety and deepen understanding of how crime affects the diverse population of Los Angeles."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset we will be using for the project is the”Crime Data from 2020 to Present,” which is collected and provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and is accessible via the U.S. government’s data portal at this link. The data is available in multiple formats, such as CSV, RDF, JSON, and XML. The dataset contains 984,046 rows and 28 columns, with each row representing a reported crime incident. The columns provide detailed information, including division record numbers, dates and times of reports, geographic areas, district numbers, types of crimes committed, weapons used, and victim demographics such as age and sex. The dataset was initially updated weekly; however, starting January 18, 2024, the LAPD temporarily shifted to a bi-weekly update schedule due to technical issues. Additionally, due to the transition of LAPD’s new Records Management System for reporting crimes and arrests since March 7th 2024, only incidents recorded in the outgoing system are currently available in the dataset. This transition may limit the completeness of recent crime records during this period. As noted by the LAPD, the data is transcribed from original and paper-based crime reports, which may introduce transcription inaccuracies. Despite these challenges, after analyzing, the dataset remains a valuable resource for analyzing crime trends in Los Angeles. For this project, the data will be imported directly in CSV format into R to facilitate cleaning and analysis."

Columns like Crm Cd 4, Crm Cd 3, and Crm Cd 2 have extremely high proportions of missing values with more than 900,000 entries missing. These columns represent secondary classification codes for crimes, while the primary classification of crimes is coded in a separate field with only 11 missing values. Since our focus is on analyzing the most serious crimes, the missing values in these secondary fields will not significantly impact our analysis. Similarly, fields such as Cross Street, Weapon Used Cd, and Weapon Desc also have substantial missing information, indicating that these attributes are likely not applicable to many incidents. This pattern is common in the sense that most crimes do not involve weapons or take place in areas without cross streets.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncrime_data &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nmissing_summary &lt;- colMeans(is.na(crime_data)) * 100\nmissing_df &lt;- data.frame(Column = names(missing_summary), MissingPercent = missing_summary)\n\nggplot(missing_df, aes(x = reorder(Column, -MissingPercent), y = MissingPercent)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Variables\", y = \"Percentage Miss\n       ing\", title = \"Missing Data by Column\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(naniar)\ngg_miss_var(crime_data)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, fields such as DR_NO (report number), Date Rptd, Crm Cd Desc(define the Crime Code provided), DATE OCC (date of occurrence), and LAT/LON (geographic coordinates) are fully populated, ensuring a reliable analysis of crimes. Some demographic fields including Vict Descent and Vict Sex have moderate amount of missing values around 140,000 entries, possibly due to privacy concerns or incomplete reporting. Overall, while missing data in some secondary variables may pose limitations for specific analyses, the completeness of essential fields ensures the dataset to be helpful for understanding trends in crime over time and space."

    "text": "3.2 Patterns and trend of Specific Types of Crimes\n\n3.2.1 How has the seriousness of crimes evolved over the years?\nFrom the data records in variable Crm Cd 1 where a series crime class number were recorded for each committed crime, we can construct a bar chart showing the amount of crime across different seriousness over years. According to Explanation of this dataset from Los Angeles Police Department, the lower class number indicate more serious case.\n\n\nCode\ncrime_data$DATE_OCC &lt;- as.Date(crime_data$DATE.OCC, format=\"%m/%d/%Y\")\ncrime_data$Year &lt;- year(crime_data$DATE_OCC)\ncrime_data$Crm.Cd.1.Class &lt;- floor(crime_data$Crm.Cd.1 / 100) * 100\nseriousness_by_year &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Year, Crm.Cd.1.Class) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(seriousness_by_year, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Count, fill = factor(Crm.Cd.1.Class))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Crime Seriousness Trends Over Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Frequency\",\n       fill = \"Crime Class (Grouped)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, we can observe that extreme cases of small crimes and large crimes consistently tend to have a rather low frequency, likely due to their rarity. Although there are some variations in the number of crimes across different seriousness levels over the five years, the dominance of crime class 300 implies that crimes with moderate seriousness, such as robbery, are more common in LA.\nThe bar chart also shows a dramatic decrement in crime in 2021 compared to 2020, followed by a relative increment in 2022 and 2023. Based on the context, the decrease in crimes could have been influenced by the quarantine policies during COVID-19 start from the end of 2020 to 2021. Later, as people returned to normal life and the economy recovered, the number of crimes also returned to a more consistent pattern. And the overall lower number of crimes in 2024 might be cause by the incomplete data.\nBut apart from external factors (like economy), the pattern of crime seriousness seems to be quite stable over years.\n\n\n3.2.2 Which crime types are most prevalent?\nNext, we can try to verify our insight from question 5.1.1 by examining the types of prevalent crimes. Crm Cd Desc records a series of detailed description of the committed crime. However, since these descriptions are highly specific, we group them by key words to make 9 broader categories to present the data more effectively for analysis. We categorize all crime types into 9 main categories: assault, theft, burglary, sex offenses, graffiti, financial crimes, public order crimes, weapon, felony, and the rest are categorized into other.\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_data &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  mutate(Crime.Category = case_when(\n    grepl(\"ASSAULT|BATTERY|ABUSE\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Assault\",\n    grepl(\"THEFT|STOLEN\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Theft\",\n    grepl(\"BURGLARY|SHOPLIFTING\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Burglary\",\n    grepl(\"SEX|RAPE|ORAL\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Sex Offenses\",\n    grepl(\"GRAFFITI|DAMAGE\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Graffiti\",\n    grepl(\"FRAUD|BUNCO|FORGERY|UNAUTHORIZED|EXTORTION\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Fraud/Financial Crimes\",\n    grepl(\"RESTRAINING|PHONE CALLS|THREATENING|LETTER\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Public Order Crimes\",\n    grepl(\"WEAPON\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Weapon\",\n    grepl(\"VANDALISM|FELONY\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Felony\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other(e.g., Arson)\"\n  ))\ncrime_summary &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(Frequency)\n\nggplot(crime_summary, aes(x = reorder(Crime.Category, Frequency), y = Frequency, fill = Frequency)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Crime Categories\",\n       x = \"Crime Category\",\n       y = \"Frequency\",\n       fill = \"Frequency\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also include an alluvial graph here to highlight the distribution of crime seriousness levels for various crime types we defined above. But for better visualization, we exclude the 3 less frequent crime types.\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- grouped_data |&gt; \n  filter(!Crime.Category %in% c(\"Fraud/Financial Crimes\", \"Graffiti\", \"Sex Offenses\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Crime.Category, Crm.Cd.1.Class) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nfiltered_data$Crm.Cd.1.Class &lt;- as.factor(filtered_data$Crm.Cd.1.Class)\n\nfiltered_data$Crime.Category &lt;- recode(filtered_data$Crime.Category,\n                                       \"Other(e.g., Arson)\" = \"Other Crimes\",\n                                       \"Public Order Crimes\" = \"Public Order\")\n\nggplot(filtered_data,\n       aes(axis1 = Crime.Category, axis2 = Crm.Cd.1.Class, y = Frequency)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Crm.Cd.1.Class), width = 1/8, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_stratum(width = 1/6, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 2.5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set3\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Crime Seriousness Across Crime Types\",\n       x = \"Crime Types                                                    Seriousness Levels\",\n       y = \"Frequency\",\n       fill = \"Crime Class\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the frequecy list, it is obvious that most prevalent record cases are theft related crimes. This seems to align with the insight from the previous question, where crimes of moderate seriousness were shown to be the most prevalent. And our alluvial graph also indicate the same idea.\nTheft and burglary, which are less violent but common crime, are reasonably belong to crime class 300-500. This can also proved by the alluvial graph where theft crime have cases from seriousness 300-500 and burglary mainly consist by cases from seriousness class 300.\nThen we can see assault, including battery and abuse, also take a great proportion of total recorded crimes. It is not surprising for this result as disputes with homeless people and mental illness are not uncommon in Los Angeles. What’s interesting is that assault consist cases from both seriousness class 600 and 300. This might depends on the type of assault that being conducted.\nOn the contrary, fraud/financial crime and graffiti are less often to be caught. It could because it is harder to caught those suspects. But overall they represent more specific or severe cases that occur in smaller numbers.\n\n\n3.2.3 Where do this specific types of crimes occur most frequently?\nBefore we dive into this question, let’s see how may distinct areas are recorded in this data set.\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_data |&gt;\n  distinct(AREA, AREA.NAME) |&gt;\n  arrange(AREA) |&gt;\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Area Code\", \"Area Name\"), align = \"c\")\n\n\n\n\n\nArea Code\nArea Name\n\n\n\n\n1\nCentral\n\n\n2\nRampart\n\n\n3\nSouthwest\n\n\n4\nHollenbeck\n\n\n5\nHarbor\n\n\n6\nHollywood\n\n\n7\nWilshire\n\n\n8\nWest LA\n\n\n9\nVan Nuys\n\n\n10\nWest Valley\n\n\n11\nNortheast\n\n\n12\n77th Street\n\n\n13\nNewton\n\n\n14\nPacific\n\n\n15\nN Hollywood\n\n\n16\nFoothill\n\n\n17\nDevonshire\n\n\n18\nSoutheast\n\n\n19\nMission\n\n\n20\nOlympic\n\n\n21\nTopanga\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it turns out that there are 21 areas here. Let’s take the top 2 common crime type from our previous result and investigate where do they usually happened. Since the top 2 crime type are theft and assault, we filter them separately on the data set while group by area name to make two interactive maps for difference comparison.\n\n\nCode\ntheft_geo_map &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(Crime.Category == \"Theft\") |&gt;\n  group_by(AREA.NAME) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), Latitude = mean(LAT), Longitude = mean(LON), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nleaflet(data = theft_geo_map) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude,\n    radius = ~sqrt(Frequency) / 5,\n    color = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = theft_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillColor = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = theft_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    popup = ~paste(\"&lt;b&gt;Area:&lt;/b&gt;\", AREA.NAME, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \"&lt;b&gt;Frequency:&lt;/b&gt;\", Frequency)\n  ) |&gt;\n  addLegend(\n    \"bottomright\", \n    pal = colorNumeric(\"Purples\", domain = theft_geo_map$Frequency),\n    values = ~Frequency, \n    title = \"Theft Frequency\",\n    opacity = 1\n  ) |&gt; \n  addControl(\n    html = \"&lt;h3&gt;Theft Crime in LAs&lt;/h3&gt;\",\n    position = \"topright\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the theft frequency map, it shows that most areas have similar theft cases overall. However, some regions like Pacific, Southwest, Central, and even N. Hollywood display higher frequencies compared to others. We assume that the prevalence of theft crimes in these areas could be caused by tourist attractions and more active commercial activities. With crowds providing cover, thefts can more easily commit crimes. Meanwhile, areas like Foothill and Hollenbeck, which are labeled with lighter colors on the map, indicate lower theft crimes These places are more residential, located farther from economically developed regions, and have sparser populations. Consequently, theft crimes are less frequent in these areas.\nThis observation suggests that the judicial department should deploy more police forces to economically developed and densely populated areas to safeguard people’s property and reduce the high number of theft incidents.\n\n\nCode\nassault_geo_map  &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(Crime.Category == \"Assault\") |&gt;\n  group_by(AREA.NAME) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), Latitude = mean(LAT), Longitude = mean(LON), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nleaflet(data = assault_geo_map) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude,\n    radius = ~sqrt(Frequency) / 5,\n    color = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = assault_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillColor = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = assault_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    popup = ~paste(\"&lt;b&gt;Area:&lt;/b&gt;\", AREA.NAME, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \"&lt;b&gt;Frequency:&lt;/b&gt;\", Frequency)\n  ) |&gt;\n  addLegend(\n    \"bottomright\", \n    pal = colorNumeric(\"Purples\", domain = assault_geo_map $Frequency),\n    values = ~Frequency, \n    title = \"Assault Frequency\",\n    opacity = 1\n  ) |&gt; \n  addControl(\n    html = \"&lt;h3&gt;Assault Crime in LA&lt;/h3&gt;\",\n    position = \"topright\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the map of assault crime frequency, it shows that areas such as 77th Street, Southeast, and Central have higher frequencies of assault crimes compared to other regions. These areas overlap with regions where more theft crimes occur, and they also share features such as more prosperous commerce and higher population density. In contrast, areas farther from the central region seem to experience fewer assault crimes. Residents in these areas are more likely to be peaceful locals.\nSo we can infer that factors contributing to higher crime rates for both theft and assault could include economic conditions, living challenges, and population density. Areas with high populations but insufficient police resources may face higher crime rates. Assault frequencies tend to be higher in city centers, transportation hubs, and entertainment areas, where interactions and conflicts are more likely to occur.\n\n\n3.2.4 When are top 4 specific crimes most likely to occur?\nNow we have some insights into the patterns and factors influencing specific types of crime, we try to provide more accurate suggestions for interventions. To achieve this, it is important to also take a look on how time factors might affect crime patterns further.\nWe pick the top 4 crime types and examine how their frequency varies on different months and times of the day.\n\n\nCode\ntop_4_crimes &lt;- grouped_data |&gt; \n  count(Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:4) |&gt;\n  pull(Crime.Category)\n\ntop_crimes_data &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(Crime.Category %in% top_4_crimes) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Month = format(as.Date(DATE_OCC), \"%B\"),\n    Hour = as.integer(TIME.OCC / 100)\n  )\n\n\nmonthly_data &lt;- top_crimes_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Month, Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.name))\n#plot 1: monthly\nggplot(monthly_data, aes(x = Month, y = Count, group = Crime.Category, color = Crime.Category)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Crime Occurrences by Month\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Frequency\",\n    color = \"Crime Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))\n\n\nWarning in geom_point(linewidth = 2): Ignoring unknown parameters: `linewidth`\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the monthly graph, it is not surprising to see that theft remains a year-round common crime. However, the trend shows a slight decrease from the beginning of the year to the end. The fluctuation in assault frequency is smaller, with a noticeable decrease in November and December, which might be influenced by the holiday season. In addition, both burglary and other crimes exhibit stable trends, suggesting their frequencies are not significantly affected by season or month.\nOverall, while certain types of crimes show sightly variations in frequency across different months, the monthly graph indicates that there isn’t a strong relationship between month and crime rate.\n\n\nCode\nhourly_data &lt;- top_crimes_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Hour, Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Plot 2: Hourly\nggplot(hourly_data, aes(x = Hour, y = Count, group = Crime.Category, color = Crime.Category)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Crime Occurrences by Hour\",\n    x = \"Hour of the Day\",\n    y = \"Frequency\",\n    color = \"Crime Type\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hour graph also provides some interesting insights. Theft crimes show a dramatic increase during the morning period, especially between 6 AM and 12 PM, and gradually decrease from 6 PM to the early morning of next day. This pattern aligns with opportunities for theft when people are commuting to or from work. Assaults increase during the daytime and decline after 9 PM, which might related to social interactions in public spaces during the day. Burglary shows slightly higher occurrences in the evening hours, as criminals often rely on the cover of darkness. And other crimes remain consistent throughout the day.\nCompared to the monthly graph, the hour graph gives us more valuable insights about how time influences crime patterns. The morning period is the peak for theft and assault crimes, which might due to commuting traffic and crowded public spaces. The evening is the peak for burglaries. Based on these observations, we recommend strengthening public security by increasing police presence in high-traffic areas during morning rush hours and enhancing security in residential areas in night time to reduce burglary cases."

For female victims, crime incidents peak between the ages of 25–37, after which there is a consistent decreasing trend. For male victims, the peak occurs slightly later, between ages 35–37, with a secondary peak around age 50. Before age 35, more incidents occur to females, but after that, males experience higher incident rates.\nFor both genders, adults aged 20–40 are the most frequent targets of crimes. This group appears to be the most accessible or vulnerable to criminal activities due to higher exposure or lifestyle-related factors.\n\nFrom our analysis, young adults and adults (20–40 years old) are mostly affected by crimes with crime rates peaking during this period. Younger females are more likely to be victims, particularly in their mid-to-late 20s, while middle-aged males are more likely to be victims, especially in their late 30s to 50s. The gap in crime incidents between genders narrows with age, suggesting possibledifferences in vulnerbility to crimes based on age and sex.\n\n\n3.3.2 How do crime types differ by gender?\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(victim_sex == \"F\" | victim_sex == \"M\" ) |&gt;\n  filter(victim_age &gt;0)|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Crime_Category, fill = victim_sex)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +  # Use dodge for side-by-side bars\n  labs(\n    title = \"Crime Types by Victim Sex\",\n    x = \"Crime Category\",\n    y = \"Number of Incidents\",\n    fill = \"Victim Sex\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarks:\n\nTheft and assault are the most frequent crime types happen to both females and males.\nFemales are more likely to experience assault, sex offenses, and public order crimes such as threatening or harassment. In contrast, males are more affected by burglary, felony, fraud, crimes like arson, theft, and weapon-related incidents.\nGender differences are subtle in crimes like felony and weapon involved cases, suggesting these crimes are less influenced by gender societal patterns.\n\nTheft and assault are the most frequently reported crimes. Female victims are more likely to experience assault, public order crimes, and sex offenses, while males are more affected by burglary, felony, fraud, other(e.g., Arson), theft , and weapon involved crimes. These differences highlight the role of gender as a contributing factor in the relationship between types of crimes and gender. However, certain crimes such as felony and weapon related offenses show minimal gender differences.\n\n\n3.3.3 How do crime patterns differ across age groups?\nSince there are over 100 values of ages recorded including 0 and some negative values, it’s hard to know the meanings behind those values, we choose to remove such values. In addition, for better analyzing, we first categorize age groups by child, teen, young adult, adult, and senior.\n\n\nCode\nage_grouped_data&lt;-grouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(victim_sex == \"F\" | victim_sex == \"M\" ) |&gt;\n  filter(victim_age &gt;0)|&gt;\n  mutate(Age_Group = case_when(\n    victim_age &lt; 12 ~ \"Child\",\n    victim_age &gt;= 12 & victim_age &lt; 18 ~ \"Teen\",\n    victim_age &gt;= 18 & victim_age &lt; 21 ~ \"Young Adult\",\n    victim_age &gt;= 18 & victim_age &lt; 65 ~ \"Adult\",\n    victim_age &gt;= 65 ~ \"Senior\"\n  ))|&gt;\n  mutate(Age_Group = factor(Age_Group, levels = c(\"Child\", \"Teen\", \"Young Adult\", \"Adult\", \"Senior\")))\n\nage_grouped_data|&gt;\n  group_by(Age_Group, victim_sex, Crime_Category) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Age_Group) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count) * 100)|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Crime_Category, y = Proportion, fill = victim_sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), width = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Age_Group, ncol = 5) +  # Facet with 5 columns\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Crime Types by Victim Sex Across Age Groups\",\n    subtitle = \"Age Group Definitions: Child (0-12), Teen (13-17), Young Adult (18-25), Adult (26-64), Senior (65+)\",\n    caption = \"Data Source: LAPD | Age group definitions based on demographic standards\",\n    x = \"Crime Category\",\n    y = \"Proportion (%)\",\n    fill = \"Victim Sex\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30), labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  # Standardized y-axis limits\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),  \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 8, face = \"italic\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarks:\n\nFor children, assault and crimes categorized as “other” (e.g., arson) are the most dominant incident types. Females are more affected by “other” crimes and sex offenses, while males are more affected by assault and weapon-related crimes. Gender does not significantly influence public order crimes or theft for this age group.\nTeens mainly experience assault, other(e,g., arson), sex offenses, theft, and weapon. Females are more frequently victims of assault and sex offenses, with a significant gap of around 8% in the proportion of sex offenses compared to males.\nYoung adults exhibit a diverse crime exposure with theft, assault, burglary, felony, other,public order crimes, sex offenses, theft, and weapon. Females experience more assault, public order crimes, and sex offenses.\nAdults show a similar crime exposure pattern to young adults, with females experiencing more assault, public order crimes, and sex offenses.\nSeniors have a similar pattern but with significantly fewer sex offenses and more theft crimes. Males experience more crimes than females except for the public order type.\n\nCrime types vary significantly across age groups. Children and teens are most affected by assault, other(e.g., Arson), and sex offenses, where females are significantly more vulnerable to sex offenses. Young adults, adults, and seniors face a broader range of crimes, including burglary, fraud, and theft, with similar proportions across categories. It’s worth noting that for all age groups, females experience more sex offenses than males, while males are more affected by weapon related crimes. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring prevention strategies to specific age groups and gender differences among crimes.\n\n\n3.3.4 What are the resolutions of different crime types?\nAfter having a better understanding of the relationship between victim characteristics like sex and age and criminal incidents, we want to further analyze how do resolution rates vary by different crime types.\nAfter initial inspection of the crime records, we can see only a few crimes that are marked as JO, JA, CC, which represent juvenile other, juvenile arrest, case closed. For the sake of the analysis, we choose to only focus on AO, AA, and IC, which represent adult other, adult arrest, and investigation continued.\n\n\nCode\ncrime_summary2 &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Crime_Category, status) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")|&gt;\n  group_by(Crime_Category) |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100) |&gt;\n  filter(status == \"AA\" | status == \"AO\" |status == \"IC\")\n\nggplot(crime_summary2, aes(x = status, y = Percentage, fill = status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Crime_Category, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Crime Types and Their Resolutions\",\n    subtitle = \"Case Status Definitions: AA (Adult Arrest), AO (Adult Other), IC (Investogation Continued)\",\n    x = \"Case Status\",\n    y = \"Resolution Rate (%)\",\n    fill = \"Case Status\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, face = \"italic\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 7, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark:\n\nAcross all crime types, the majority of cases are unresolved and still under investigation. Felonies, burglary, fraud, theft, and graffiti have higher unsolved cases.\nWe can see there tends to be more cases classified as “AO” (Adult Other) than “AA” (Adult Arrest),which means more cases involving an adult where no arrest was made, but some other action was taken. Assault, other(e.g., Arson), public order crimes, sex offenses, and weapon have relatively higher proportions of resolved cases (AA and AO statuses).\n\nThe analysis of case statuses reveals that most crimes remain unresolved (“IC” status). Among them, felony and graffiti have the highest proportion of unresolved cases that are still under investigation, which suggest the complexity of these cases and lack of clear evidence. Assault, weapon, public order crimes and other have relatively higher proportion of resolution rates, which may be due to nature of those cases: presence of witnesses, or supporting evidence such as surveillance cameras that’s nowadays common in public. This disparity shows the challenges of resolving certain crime types and the need for targeted strategies to improve case resolution rates.\n\n\n3.3.5 How does crime resolution vary by area and crime type?\nNow we want to further see do crime resolution rates vary by different divisions of LAPD to have a better understanding of the nature of crimes.\n\n\nCode\narea_case_summary &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  group_by(area_name, status) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")|&gt;\n  group_by(area_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count) * 100) |&gt;\n  mutate(area_name = reorder(area_name, -Proportion * (status == \"IC\")))|&gt;\n  filter(status == \"IC\" |status == \"AO\" |status == \"AA\")\ngrouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(status %in% c(\"AA\", \"IC\"))|&gt;\n  group_by(Crime_Category, area_name, status) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")|&gt;\n  group_by(area_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count) * 100) |&gt;\n  filter(Crime_Category %in% c(\"Assault\", \"Burglary\", \"Felony\", \"Other(e.g., Arson)\", \"Theft\", \"Weapon\"))|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Proportion, y = reorder(area_name, Proportion), color = status)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.25) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Crime_Category) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Cleveland Dot Plot of Case Status Proportions by Area\",\n    x = \"Proportion (%)\",\n    y = \"Area Name\",\n    color = \"status\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark:\n\nFor all crime types and all districts of LAPD, there are more unresolved cases.The gap between resolved and unresolved cases is the largest when it come to theft.\nWe can see for burglary, felony, and weapon involved crimes, they have more consistent resolution rates across all divisions of LAPD. All divisions have relatively higher resolution rates for assault.\nMission division has the highest resolution rate for assault; North Hollywood has the highest resolution rate for other crimes like arson, and Topanga has the highest resolution rate for theft.\n\nThe resolution of specific crime types vary across LAPD districts. All neighborhoods have more unresolved cases. Overall, assault and other crimes like arson have higher resolution rates. There’s slight inconsistency across different neighborhoods regarding efficiency in solving crimes, which may highlight disparities in justice outcomes and the need for equitable resource distribution."

    "text": "By creating various graphs, we analyzed patterns and trends across different crime types, gaining a deeper understanding of their nature and impact. Theft-related crimes emerged as the most prevalent, particularly in regions like Pacific, Southwest, and Central LA, highlighting the need for increased police presence to protect property in these areas. Central LA also reported higher assault rates, underscoring the importance of government involvement in addressing violent crime. Temporal patterns revealed that theft and assault peak in the morning, while burglaries are more frequent during the evening, again emphasizing the need for enhanced police deployment during these critical times in high-traffic and downtown areas. Delving deeper into victim demographics, younger females and middle-aged males were found to be more vulnerable to crimes. Females of all age groups were disproportionately affected by sex offenses, whereas males were more frequently victims of weapon-related crimes. This demonstrates that victim characteristics such as age and sex significantly influence the types of crimes experienced. Lastly, the analysis of crime resolution rates exposed disparities in justice outcomes. High volume of unresolved cases across all districts show a potential shortage of police resources or investigative capacity. In conclusion, allocating more police resources is strongly recommended to both preventing crimes more effectively and improving the resolution rates. By enhancing police presence in high-risk areas during critical times, as well as addressing resource shortages for investigations, law enforcement can better safeguard communities and promote justice outcomes.\nHowever, the analysis is limited by potential reporting biases and missing values, which may be due to privacy concerns or inconsistencies in data collection. Additionally, we excluded certain values whose meanings were unclear, which could have inadvertently introduced bias into the analysis. A key lesson learned from this study is the importance of addressing ambiguities and enhancing the accuracy of findings, which may involve reaching out to the original data source for clarification and additional context when needed. Last, we may enrich our insights by integrating complementary datasets that provide a more comprehensive perspective —for example, datasets that include additional demographic variables beyond age and sex."
