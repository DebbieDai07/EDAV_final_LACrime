    "text": "1 Introduction\nCrime rate is one of the most critical problems that draws attention from residents and society, as it is closely related to the well-being and safety of our daily lives. Los Angeles (LA), as a populous, major city in the United States with a prosperous economy and developed tourism, is also known for its high crime rate. The diversity of LA has resulted in a variety of crime types, with significant differences due to factors such as race, gender, and community.\nIn our project, we intend to use the dataset provided by the Los Angeles Police Department to analyze crime data in Los Angeles. We plan to explore various trends, such as the prevalence of specific crimes in different communities and time patterns of crime peaks during certain periods of the year or day. We also aim to understand the factors that contribute to variations in crime rates. By finding answers through our analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights for community members, police officers, and policymakers to work more effectively. Ultimately, we hope our analysis will guide important decision-making to enhance public safety and deepen understanding of how crime affects the diverse population of Los Angeles."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset we will be using for the project is the”Crime Data from 2020 to Present,” which is collected and provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and is accessible via the U.S. government’s data portal at this link https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present. The data is available in multiple formats, such as CSV, RDF, JSON, and XML. The dataset contains 984,046 rows and 28 columns, with each row representing a reported crime incident. The columns provide detailed information, including division record numbers, dates and times of reports, geographic areas, district numbers, types of crimes committed, weapons used, and victim demographics such as age and sex. The dataset was initially updated weekly; however, starting January 18, 2024, the LAPD temporarily shifted to a bi-weekly update schedule due to technical issues. Additionally, due to the transition of LAPD’s new Records Management System for reporting crimes and arrests since March 7th 2024, only incidents recorded in the outgoing system are currently available in the dataset. This transition may limit the completeness of recent crime records during this period. As noted by the LAPD, the data is transcribed from original and paper-based crime reports, which may introduce transcription inaccuracies. Despite these challenges, after analyzing, the dataset remains a valuable resource for analyzing crime trends in Los Angeles. For this project, the data will be imported directly in CSV format into R to facilitate cleaning and analysis."

    "section": "2.2 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nTo perform the missing value analysis of the dataset, we summarized the number of missing entries for each column. Columns like Crm Cd 4, Crm Cd 3, and Crm Cd 2 have extremely high proportions of missing values with more than 900,000 entries missing. These columns represent secondary classification codes for crimes, while the primary classification of crimes is coded in a separate field with only 11 missing values. Since our focus is on analyzing the most serious crimes, the missing values in these secondary fields will not significantly impact our analysis. Similarly, fields such as Cross Street, Weapon Used Cd, and Weapon Desc also have substantial missing information, indicating that these attributes are likely not applicable to many incidents. This pattern is common in the sense that most crimes do not involve weapons or take place in areas without cross streets.\nOn the other hand, fields such as DR_NO (report number), Date Rptd, Crm Cd Desc(define the Crime Code provided), DATE OCC (date of occurrence), and LAT/LON (geographic coordinates) are fully populated, ensuring a reliable analysis of crimes. Some demographic fields including Vict Descent and Vict Sex have moderate amount of missing values around 140,000 entries, possibly due to privacy concerns or incomplete reporting. Overall, while missing data in some secondary variables may pose limitations for specific analyses, the completeness of essential fields ensures the dataset to be helpful for understanding trends in crime over time and space."
