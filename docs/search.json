    "text": "1 Introduction\nCrime rate is one of the most critical problems that draws attention from residents and society, as it is closely related to the well-being and safety of our daily lives. Los Angeles (LA), as a populous in the United States with a prosperous economy and developed tourism, is also known for its high crime rate. The diversity of LA has resulted in a variety of crime types, with significant differences due to factors such as race, gender, and community.\nIn our project, we intend to use the dataset provided by the Los Angeles Police Department to analyze crime data in Los Angeles. We plan to explore various trends, such as the prevalence of specific crimes in different communities and time patterns of crime peaks during certain periods of the year or day. We also aim to understand the factors that contribute to variations in crime rates. By finding answers through our analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights for community members, police officers, and policymakers to work more effectively. Ultimately, we hope our analysis will guide important decision making to enhance public safety and deepen understanding of how crime affects the diverse population of Los Angeles.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset we will be using for the project is the”Crime Data from 2020 to Present,” which is collected and provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and is accessible via the U.S. government’s data portal at this link. The data is available in multiple formats, such as CSV, RDF, JSON, and XML. The dataset contains 984,046 rows and 28 columns, with each row representing a reported crime incident. The columns provide detailed information, including division record numbers, dates and times of reports, geographic areas, district numbers, types of crimes committed, weapons used, and victim demographics such as age and sex. The dataset was initially updated weekly; however, starting January 18, 2024, the LAPD temporarily shifted to a bi-weekly update schedule due to technical issues. Additionally, due to the transition of LAPD’s new Records Management System for reporting crimes and arrests since March 7th 2024, only incidents recorded in the outgoing system are currently available in the dataset. This transition may limit the completeness of recent crime records during this period. As noted by the LAPD, the data is transcribed from original and paper-based crime reports, which may introduce transcription inaccuracies. Despite these challenges, after analyzing, the dataset remains a valuable resource for analyzing crime trends in Los Angeles. For this project, the data will be imported directly in CSV format into R to facilitate cleaning and analysis.",

Columns like Crm Cd 4, Crm Cd 3, and Crm Cd 2 have extremely high proportions of missing values with more than 900,000 entries missing. These columns represent secondary classification codes for crimes, while the primary classification of crimes is coded in a separate field with only 11 missing values. Since our focus is on analyzing the most serious crimes, the missing values in these secondary fields will not significantly impact our analysis. Similarly, fields such as Cross Street, Weapon Used Cd, and Weapon Desc also have substantial missing information, indicating that these attributes are likely not applicable to many incidents. This pattern is common in the sense that most crimes do not involve weapons or take place in areas without cross streets.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncrime_data &lt;- read.csv(file='../../data/Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv')\n\nmissing_summary &lt;- colMeans(is.na(crime_data)) * 100\nmissing_df &lt;- data.frame(Column = names(missing_summary), MissingPercent = missing_summary)\n\nggplot(missing_df, aes(x = reorder(Column, -MissingPercent), y = MissingPercent)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Variables\", y = \"Percentage Missing\", title = \"Missing Data by Column\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(naniar)\ngg_miss_var(crime_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, fields such as DR_NO (report number), Date Rptd, Crm Cd Desc(define the Crime Code provided), DATE OCC (date of occurrence), and LAT/LON (geographic coordinates) are fully populated, ensuring a reliable analysis of crimes. Some demographic fields including Vict Descent and Vict Sex have moderate amount of missing values around 140,000 entries, possibly due to privacy concerns or incomplete reporting. Overall, while missing data in some secondary variables may pose limitations for specific analyses, the completeness of essential fields ensures the dataset to be helpful for understanding trends in crime over time and space.",

    "text": "3.2 Patterns and trend of Specific Types of Crimes\n\n3.2.1 How has the seriousness of crimes evolved over the years?\nFrom the data records in variable Crm Cd 1 where a series crime class number were recorded for each committed crime, we can construct a bar chart showing the amount of crime across different seriousness over years. According to Explanation of this dataset from Los Angeles Police Department, the lower class number indicate more serious case.\n\n\nCode\n# Convert date and get year data\ncrime_data$DATE_OCC &lt;- as.Date(crime_data$DATE.OCC, format=\"%m/%d/%Y\")\ncrime_data$Year &lt;- year(crime_data$DATE_OCC)\n\n# Group seriousness\ncrime_data$Crm.Cd.1.Class &lt;- floor(crime_data$Crm.Cd.1 / 100) * 100\n\n# Group by Year and Crm Cd 1 Class, and count frequency\nseriousness_by_year &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Year, Crm.Cd.1.Class) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(seriousness_by_year, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Count, fill = factor(Crm.Cd.1.Class))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Crime Seriousness Trends Over Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Frequency\",\n       fill = \"Crime Class (Grouped)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, we can observe that extreme cases of small crimes and large crimes consistently tend to have a rather low frequency, likely due to their rarity. Although there are some variations in the number of crimes across different seriousness levels over the five years, the dominance of crime class 300 implies that crimes with moderate seriousness, such as robbery, are more common in LA.\nThe bar chart also shows a dramatic decrement in crime in 2021 compared to 2020, followed by a relative increment in 2022 and 2023. Based on the context, the decrease in crimes could have been influenced by the quarantine policies during COVID-19 start from the end of 2020 to 2021. Later, as people returned to normal life and the economy recovered, the number of crimes also returned to a more consistent pattern. And the overall lower number of crimes in 2024 might be cause by the incomplete data.\nBut apart from external factors (like economy), the pattern of crime seriousness seems to be quite stable over years.\n\n\n3.2.2 Which crime types are most prevalent?\nNext, we can try to verify our insight from question 5.1.1 by examining the types of prevalent crimes. Crm Cd Desc records a series of detailed description of the committed crime. However, since these descriptions are highly specific, we group them by key words to make 9 broader categories to present the data more effectively for analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the groups for crime types\ngrouped_data &lt;- crime_data |&gt;\n  mutate(Crime.Category = case_when(\n    grepl(\"ASSAULT|BATTERY|ABUSE\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Assault\",\n    grepl(\"THEFT|STOLEN\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Theft\",\n    grepl(\"BURGLARY|SHOPLIFTING\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Burglary\",\n    grepl(\"SEX|RAPE|ORAL\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Sex Offenses\",\n    grepl(\"GRAFFITI|DAMAGE\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Graffiti\",\n    grepl(\"FRAUD|BUNCO|FORGERY|UNAUTHORIZED|EXTORTION\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Fraud/Financial Crimes\",\n    grepl(\"RESTRAINING|PHONE CALLS|THREATENING|LETTER\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Public Order Crimes\",\n    grepl(\"WEAPON\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Weapon\",\n    grepl(\"VANDALISM|FELONY\", Crm.Cd.Desc, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ \"Felony\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other(e.g., Arson)\"\n  ))\n\n# Summarize\ncrime_summary &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(Frequency)\n\nggplot(crime_summary, aes(x = reorder(Crime.Category, Frequency), y = Frequency, fill = Frequency)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  coord_flip() + # Flip the coordinates for horizontal bars\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Crime Categories\",\n       x = \"Crime Category\",\n       y = \"Frequency\",\n       fill = \"Frequency\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also include an alluvial graph here to highlight the distribution of crime seriousness levels for various crime types we defined above. But for better visualization, we exclude the 3 less frequent crime types.\n\n\nCode\n# Exclude 3 less frequent crime types\nfiltered_data &lt;- grouped_data |&gt; \n  filter(!Crime.Category %in% c(\"Fraud/Financial Crimes\", \"Graffiti\", \"Sex Offenses\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(Crime.Category, Crm.Cd.1.Class) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nfiltered_data$Crm.Cd.1.Class &lt;- as.factor(filtered_data$Crm.Cd.1.Class)\n\n# Recode category for better visualization\nfiltered_data$Crime.Category &lt;- recode(filtered_data$Crime.Category,\n                                       \"Other(e.g., Arson)\" = \"Other Crimes\",\n                                       \"Public Order Crimes\" = \"Public Order\")\n\nggplot(filtered_data,\n       aes(axis1 = Crime.Category, axis2 = Crm.Cd.1.Class, y = Frequency)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Crm.Cd.1.Class), width = 1/8, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_stratum(width = 1/6, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 2.5) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set3\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Crime Seriousness Across Crime Types\",\n       x = \"Crime Types                                                    Seriousness Levels\",\n       y = \"Frequency\",\n       fill = \"Crime Class\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the frequecy list, it is obvious that most prevalent record cases are theft related crimes. This seems to align with the insight from the previous question, where crimes of moderate seriousness were shown to be the most prevalent. And our alluvial graph also indicate the same idea.\nTheft and burglary, which are less violent but common crime, are reasonably belong to crime class 300-500. This can also proved by the alluvial graph where theft crime have cases from seriousness 300-500 and burglary mainly consist by cases from seriousness class 300.\nThen we can see assault, including battery and abuse, also take a great proportion of total recorded crimes. It is not surprising for this result as disputes with homeless people and mental illness are not uncommon in Los Angeles. What’s interesting is that assault consist cases from both seriousness class 600 and 300. This might depends on the type of assault that being conducted.\nOn the contrary, fraud/financial crime and graffiti are less often to be caught. It could because it is harder to caught those suspects. But overall they represent more specific or severe cases that occur in smaller numbers.\n\n\n3.2.3 Where do this specific types of crimes occur most frequently?\nBefore we dive into this question, let’s see how may distinct areas are recorded in this data set.\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_data |&gt;\n  distinct(AREA, AREA.NAME) |&gt;\n  arrange(AREA) |&gt;\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Area Code\", \"Area Name\"), align = \"c\")\n\n\n\n\n\nArea Code\nArea Name\n\n\n\n\n1\nCentral\n\n\n2\nRampart\n\n\n3\nSouthwest\n\n\n4\nHollenbeck\n\n\n5\nHarbor\n\n\n6\nHollywood\n\n\n7\nWilshire\n\n\n8\nWest LA\n\n\n9\nVan Nuys\n\n\n10\nWest Valley\n\n\n11\nNortheast\n\n\n12\n77th Street\n\n\n13\nNewton\n\n\n14\nPacific\n\n\n15\nN Hollywood\n\n\n16\nFoothill\n\n\n17\nDevonshire\n\n\n18\nSoutheast\n\n\n19\nMission\n\n\n20\nOlympic\n\n\n21\nTopanga\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it turns out that there are 21 areas here. Let’s take the top 2 common crime type from our previous result and investigate where do they usually happened. Since the top 2 crime type are theft and assault, we filter them separately on the data set while group by area name to make two interactive maps for difference comparison.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter Theft category\ntheft_geo_map &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(Crime.Category == \"Theft\") |&gt;\n  group_by(AREA.NAME) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), Latitude = mean(LAT), Longitude = mean(LON), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nleaflet(data = theft_geo_map) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude,\n    radius = ~sqrt(Frequency) / 5,\n    color = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = theft_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillColor = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = theft_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    popup = ~paste(\"&lt;b&gt;Area:&lt;/b&gt;\", AREA.NAME, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \"&lt;b&gt;Frequency:&lt;/b&gt;\", Frequency)\n  ) |&gt;\n  addLegend(\n    \"bottomright\", \n    pal = colorNumeric(\"Purples\", domain = theft_geo_map$Frequency),\n    values = ~Frequency, \n    title = \"Theft Frequency\",\n    opacity = 1\n  ) |&gt; \n  addControl(\n    html = \"&lt;h3&gt;Theft Crime in LAs&lt;/h3&gt;\",\n    position = \"topright\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the theft frequency map, it shows that most areas have similar theft cases overall. However, some regions like Pacific, Southwest, Central, and even N. Hollywood display higher frequencies compared to others. We assume that the prevalence of theft crimes in these areas could be caused by tourist attractions and more active commercial activities. With crowds providing cover, thefts can more easily commit crimes. Meanwhile, areas like Foothill and Hollenbeck, which are labeled with lighter colors on the map, indicate lower theft crimes These places are more residential, located farther from economically developed regions, and have sparser populations. Consequently, theft crimes are less frequent in these areas.\nThis observation suggests that the judicial department should deploy more police forces to economically developed and densely populated areas to safeguard people’s property and reduce the high number of theft incidents.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter Assault category\nassault_geo_map  &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(Crime.Category == \"Assault\") |&gt;\n  group_by(AREA.NAME) |&gt;\n  summarize(Frequency = n(), Latitude = mean(LAT), Longitude = mean(LON), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nleaflet(data = assault_geo_map) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude,\n    radius = ~sqrt(Frequency) / 5,\n    color = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = assault_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillColor = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"Purples\", domain = assault_geo_map $Frequency)(Frequency),\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    popup = ~paste(\"&lt;b&gt;Area:&lt;/b&gt;\", AREA.NAME, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \"&lt;b&gt;Frequency:&lt;/b&gt;\", Frequency)\n  ) |&gt;\n  addLegend(\n    \"bottomright\", \n    pal = colorNumeric(\"Purples\", domain = assault_geo_map $Frequency),\n    values = ~Frequency, \n    title = \"Assault Frequency\",\n    opacity = 1\n  ) |&gt; \n  addControl(\n    html = \"&lt;h3&gt;Assault Crime in LA&lt;/h3&gt;\",\n    position = \"topright\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the map of assault crime frequency, it shows that areas such as 77th Street, Southeast, and Central have higher frequencies of assault crimes compared to other regions. These areas overlap with regions where more theft crimes occur, and they also share features such as more prosperous commerce and higher population density. In contrast, areas farther from the central region seem to experience fewer assault crimes. Residents in these areas are more likely to be peaceful locals.\nSo we can infer that factors contributing to higher crime rates for both theft and assault could include economic conditions, living challenges, and population density. Areas with high populations but insufficient police resources may face higher crime rates. Assault frequencies tend to be higher in city centers, transportation hubs, and entertainment areas, where interactions and conflicts are more likely to occur.\n\n\n3.2.4 When are top 4 specific crimes most likely to occur?\nNow we have some insights into the patterns and factors influencing specific types of crime, we try to provide more accurate suggestions for interventions. To achieve this, it is important to also take a look on how time factors might affect crime patterns further.\nWe pick the top 4 crime types and examine how their frequency varies on different months and times of the day.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter the top 4 crimes on desc(frequency)\ntop_4_crimes &lt;- grouped_data |&gt; \n  count(Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:4) |&gt;\n  pull(Crime.Category)\n\n# Mutate columns for mouth and hour data\ntop_crimes_data &lt;- grouped_data |&gt;\n  filter(Crime.Category %in% top_4_crimes) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Month = format(as.Date(DATE_OCC), \"%B\"),\n    Hour = as.integer(TIME.OCC / 100)\n  )\n\n\nmonthly_data &lt;- top_crimes_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Month, Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.name))\n\n# Plot 1: Monthly\nggplot(monthly_data, aes(x = Month, y = Count, group = Crime.Category, color = Crime.Category)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Crime Occurrences by Month\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Frequency\",\n    color = \"Crime Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))\n\n\nWarning in geom_point(linewidth = 2): Ignoring unknown parameters: `linewidth`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the monthly graph, it is not surprising to see that theft remains a year-round common crime. However, the trend shows a slight decrease from the beginning of the year to the end. The fluctuation in assault frequency is smaller, with a noticeable decrease in November and December, which might be influenced by the holiday season. In addition, both burglary and other crimes exhibit stable trends, suggesting their frequencies are not significantly affected by season or month.\nOverall, while certain types of crimes show sightly variations in frequency across different months, the monthly graph indicates that there isn’t a strong relationship between month and crime rate.\n\n\nCode\nhourly_data &lt;- top_crimes_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Hour, Crime.Category) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Plot 2: Hourly\nggplot(hourly_data, aes(x = Hour, y = Count, group = Crime.Category, color = Crime.Category)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Crime Occurrences by Hour\",\n    x = \"Hour of the Day\",\n    y = \"Frequency\",\n    color = \"Crime Type\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hour graph also provides some interesting insights. Theft crimes show a dramatic increase during the morning period, especially between 6 AM and 12 PM, and gradually decrease from 6 PM to the early morning of next day. This pattern aligns with opportunities for theft when people are commuting to or from work. Assaults increase during the daytime and decline after 9 PM, which might related to social interactions in public spaces during the day. Burglary shows slightly higher occurrences in the evening hours, as criminals often rely on the cover of darkness. And other crimes remain consistent throughout the day.\nCompared to the monthly graph, the hour graph gives us more valuable insights about how time influences crime patterns. The morning period is the peak for theft and assault crimes, which might due to commuting traffic and crowded public spaces. The evening is the peak for burglaries. Based on these observations, we recommend strengthening public security by increasing police presence in high-traffic areas during morning rush hours and enhancing security in residential areas in night time to reduce burglary cases.",
