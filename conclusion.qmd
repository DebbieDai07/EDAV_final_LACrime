# Conclusion
By creating various graphs, we analyzed patterns and trends across different crime types, gaining a deeper understanding of their nature and impact. Theft-related crimes emerged as the most prevalent, particularly in regions like Pacific, Southwest, and Central LA, highlighting the need for increased police presence to protect property in these areas. Central LA also reported higher assault rates, underscoring the importance of government involvement in addressing violent crime. Temporal patterns revealed that theft and assault peak in the morning, while burglaries are more frequent during the evening, again emphasizing the need for enhanced police deployment during these critical times in high-traffic and downtown areas. Delving deeper into victim demographics, younger females and middle-aged males were found to be more vulnerable to crimes. Females of all age groups were disproportionately affected by sex offenses, whereas males were more frequently victims of weapon-related crimes. This demonstrates that victim characteristics such as age and sex significantly influence the types of crimes experienced. Lastly, the analysis of crime resolution rates exposed disparities in justice outcomes. High volume of unresolved cases across all districts show a potential shortage of police resources or investigative capacity. In conclusion, allocating 
more police resources is strongly recommended to both preventing crimes more effectively and improving the resolution rates. By enhancing police presence in high-risk areas during critical times, as well as addressing resource shortages for investigations, law enforcement can better safeguard communities and promote justice outcomes. 

However, the analysis is limited by potential reporting biases and missing values, which may be due to privacy concerns or inconsistencies in data collection. Additionally, we excluded certain values whose meanings were unclear, which could have inadvertently introduced bias into the analysis. A key lesson learned from this study is the importance of addressing ambiguities and enhancing the accuracy of findings, which may involve reaching out to the original data source for clarification and additional context when needed. Last, we may enrich our insights by integrating complementary datasets that provide a more comprehensive perspective â€”for example, datasets that include additional demographic variables beyond age and sex.
